   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Open in VS Code and press F5 to debug
   ```

2. **Implement Basic MCP Integration**
   - Create MCP client service
   - Set up basic tool calling
   - Connect to AI services

3. **Enhance Canvas Functionality**
   - Add drag-and-drop for nodes
   - Implement zoom and pan
   - Add node selection and editing

### Short Term (Next 5 hours)
1. **File System Integration**
   - Parse workspace files
   - Generate code structure
   - Real-time file watching

2. **AI-Powered Features**
